1. Python intereactive mode is the one of the best feature, in this you can type any valid statement or sequence of statement 
   and immediately view the result.
2. When you are using python intereactly, the special variable _ holds the results of the last operation. [It is important to 
   stress this variable is only defined when working interactively]
3. print("%3d %0.2f" % (year, principal))  # Python 3
4. Format strings contain ordinary text and special formatting-character sequences such as
   "%d" , "%s" , and "%f" .
5. A more modern approach to string formatting is to format each part individually using the format() function. For example:
  print format(year,"3d"),format(principal,"0.2f")
  print(format(year,"3d"),format(principal,"0.2f")) # Python 3
  format() uses format specifiers that are similar to those used with the traditional string formatting operator ( % ).

rajiv1=1
rajiv2=5

while rajiv1 <= rajiv2:
        print format(rajiv1,"2d"), format(rajiv1,"2d")
        rajiv1+=1
